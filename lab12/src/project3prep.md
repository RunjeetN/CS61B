# Project 3 Prep

**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is always a row of tiles that may turn, leading into a room. A rooms is a collection of tiles that are connected together and a room always has entrance and exit into a hallways to ensure that every room is reachable. 

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of 
drawing a knight world and randomly generating a world 
using rooms and hallways?**

Answer: If drawing a knight world is like following a recipe, randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways is like cooking a dinner because there are mutliple little recipes that need to be followed in an arbitrary order to create the entire world. 

**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually 
get to the full knight world.**

Answer: The first method I would write would be the one to make the array of Nothing tiles that I would eventually override. 

**This question is open-ended. Write some classes 
and methods that might be useful for Project 3. Think 
about what helper methods and classes you used for the lab!**

Answer:

public void createRoom(int width, int height){}
public void createHallway(int width, int length, int numOfTurns){}
public void generateWorld();
public class BackEnd{}
public class FrontEnd{} // FrontEnd calls BackEnd methods and displays the result
